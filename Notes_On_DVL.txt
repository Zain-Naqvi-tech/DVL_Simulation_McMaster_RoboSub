IMU & Navigation
- Nortek Nucleus 1000 DVL – Doppler Velocity Log for underwater localization
- BUILT-IN: Sub-Conn cable (w/ DVL) – Waterproof interface
    - BUILT-IN: Sub-Conn to Ethernet adapter board – For DVL communication

This model returns the values:
- Velocity (x,y,z) relative to the seabed (m/s)
- Altitude (distance from the seafloor) (m)
- Status (health or error codes)
- Orientation (degrees) (only if we use add-ons)
- Confidence in reading (validity)

MCU - Teensy 4.1 has ethernet capabilities so we will use ethernet communication
